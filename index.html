                                My coaching career at Benthe completely changed my everyday life, 
                                from an almost burnt-out and discouraged leader, to a leader with 
                                self-confidence, energy, optimism, and courage in leadership life again.<br><br>
                                
                                Benthe has a special ability to listen empathetically, ask the right questions, 
                                be curious and choose the right tools in coaching work.
                                Her optimistic, positive, empathetic, professional, and not least
                                realistic approach helped make my coaching career a success for me.<br>
                                Her pleasant nature and the fact that she exudes professionalism, 
                                as well as her positive approach, resulted in a trusting 
                                and trustworthy relationship from the first consultation.<br><br>

                                In the time that has passed since I finished the course at Benthe, 
                                I have used tools and some of the things I learned in the coaching 
                                course in my managerial everyday life when I needed it.
                                Thank you Benthe for rekindling hope, joy, and enthusiasm for me.
