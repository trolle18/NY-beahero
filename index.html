                        Can you visualize it or feel it? Good if you already know what it is. Or maybe you are already living your dream.<br>
                        However, there are plenty of reasons why we don’t follow through, like:
                        Afraid to fail, no time or energy or we haven’t committed to the dream, goal or passion wholeheartedly?<br><br>
                        I can help you to get there, since my passion is professional coaching. 
                        When you start focusing on what YOU want, you will get it! When you start acting on it, you will enjoy a more fulfilling life with meaning and purpose.

                                My coaching sessions with Benthe changed my everyday life completely, 
                                from an almost burnt out and discouraged leader to a leader with 
                                self-confidence, energy, optimism and with courage for leadership again. <br><br>
                                Benthe has a special ability to listen empathetically, ask the challenging 
                                questions, be curious and choose the right tools from her toolbox in 
                                carrying out her coaching work. <br>
                                Her optimistic, positive, empathic, professional, and not least realistic 
                                approach in the coaching process contributed to my success. Her pleasant 
                                nature and the fact that she radiates professionalism as well as her positive 
                                approach, resulted in a trusting and authentic relationship from the first session. <br><br>
                                In the time that has passed since I completed the coaching sessions with Benthe, 
                                I have used the tools and some of the things I learned in the coaching process 
                                in my leadership, when I have needed it. <br><br>
                                Thank you Benthe for reigniting my hope, joy and enthusiasm.

                                This means that with Benthe's help I have reached clarification in my life, at my own pace.<br><br>
